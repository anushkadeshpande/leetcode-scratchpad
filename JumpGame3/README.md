Given an array of non-negative integers arr, you are initially positioned at start index of the array. When you are at index i, you can jump to i + arr[i] or i - arr[i], check if you can reach to any index with value 0.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

> 1. Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 5  
    Output: true 
  
> 2. Input: arr = [3,0,2,1,2], start = 2  
    Output: false
