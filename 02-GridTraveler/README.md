Say that you are a traveler on a 2D grid. You begin in the top-left corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner. You may only move down or right.
In how many ways can you travel to the goal on a grid with dimensions m * n?

1. Recursive Approach:
    -   Time Complexity: O(2 ^ (m + n))
    -   Space Complexity: O(m + n)

2. Memoized Approach:
    -   Time Complexity: O(m * n)
    -   Space Complexity: O(m + n)

3. Tabulated Approach:
    -   Time Complexity: O(m * n)
    -   Space Complexity: O(m * n)
